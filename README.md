## 🚀 Featured Projects

### **[Go BitTorrent Client](https://github.com/alif-mahi/go-bittorrent-client)**
A concurrent BitTorrent client implementation in Go from the ground up—including bencode parsing, tracker communication, pipelining, and integrity checking. Built to understand peer-to-peer protocols and high-concurrency systems.

### **[Knowledge Distillation for Wildfire Classification](https://github.com/alif-mahi/kd-research)**
Research implementing multimodal CNN/ViT teachers and a lightweight RGB-only student model via knowledge distillation. Achieved ~95% of teacher performance with 100× faster inference—focus on efficient, deployable vision models.

### **[Build Your Own Shell (Go)](https://github.com/alif-mahi/go-shell)**
A POSIX-compliant shell written in Go, built as part of the CodeCrafters challenge. Implements command execution, piping, signal handling, and job control to deepen understanding of OS interfaces and process management.
